## What is this repository?

This is a personal fork of https://github.com/posquit0/Awesome-CV repository.

Last few years I had an Awesome-CV backed Overleaf project, but decided I need to rewrite it and thought 
it would be easier to track changes in a Git repository and build it with [Nix](https://github.com/NixOS).

## What is Awesome CV?

**Awesome CV** is LaTeX template for a **CV(Curriculum Vitae)**, **Résumé** or **Cover Letter** inspired
by [Fancy CV](https://www.sharelatex.com/templates/cv-or-resume/fancy-cv). It is easy to customize your own template,
especially since it is really written by a clean, semantic markup.

else without my permission, though!
