\begin{cvparagraph}
    I have 3 roughly equivalent paths of professional development.

    I am striving to build highly automated, scalable and cloud-agnostic platform covering the whole software development lifecycle:
    starting with ergonomic local development through efficient test environments and CI/CD leading to secure, observable and highly available production.
    I keep exploring the Infrastructure as a Code, automation tooling, Kubernetes and Nix ecosystems to achieve those goals.

    I feel great working on Developer Experience topics such as internal tooling and process automation.

    I would also be happy to gradually slide back into programming-focused roles and learn a new language such as Elixir, Rust or maybe even Haskell.
